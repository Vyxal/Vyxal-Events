# 10 CMC Challenge
This is the folder of the 10 CMC challenge [Lyxal recently announced](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/58559689#58559689).  

## What?
The 10 CMC Vyxal Challenge consists of 10 Chat-Mini-Challenges. The problem must be solved in [Vyxal](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal). The person with the lowest score of all 10 challenges wins a +100 bounty.

## Where? (Not Sure)
The challenges will be posted in [The Nineteenth Byte SE Chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte) and [The Vyxal SE Chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/106764/vyxal).

## When? (Not Sure)
[Lyxal](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/78850/lyxal) planed to post the challenges after a month (contact him in the Vyxal / Nineteenth Byte Chat with @lyxal).

## How? (Not sure)
The idea is to make a private Github repository that only the [Event Managers](https://github.com/orgs/Vyxal/teams/event-managers) can see.

## Challenges
Lyxal will hopefull post the Challenges here too.
